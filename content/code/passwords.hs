-- if you want to play with taking user input, you can try
-- running that function with this `main`. `getLine` is an
-- IO action to get a string from user input and pass it
-- in as an argument. you could
-- write another branch that could take an answer to the
-- printed question and respond depending on various
-- answers. you needn't worry yet about what >>= is. it is
-- called `bind` and it binds the result of `getLine` to
-- the next function called; that is, it lets us pass that
-- result to another function, similar to what function
-- composition does. more on this later.

-- we can't do either of these because the result of each function
-- application is a `Maybe String` which cannot be passed directly
-- into the next function as a `String` argument (none of these
-- accepts a `Maybe String` as an input). these both throw type errors.

-- but instead of nesting all the cases into one very large function,
-- we can get that nested type of behavior while avoiding the
-- problem that we had with function composition and parenthesized
-- application if we use `bind` (>>=)

-- you can use `do` syntax with any monad; here
-- our monad is still `Maybe` but this is what
-- the above function makePassword looks like with
-- some `do` sugar on top
